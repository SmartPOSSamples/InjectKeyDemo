# InjectKeyDemo

## Overview

The `InjectKeyDemo` application showcases the advanced capabilities of our system to enhance security and flexibility within digital transactions. Utilizing the Android Interface Definition Language (AIDL), our application facilitates a robust mechanism for securely injecting cryptographic keys into the terminal.

### Key Injection Type:

- **Transport Keys**: Keys used to encrypt master key.
- **Master Keys**: Keys used to encrypt session/user key.
- **DUKPT Keys**: Short for Derived Unique Key Per Transaction, these keys provide a unique encryption key for each transaction, significantly enhancing security.

This comprehensive approach to key management ensures that our system remains adaptable to various security requirements, providing a seamless and secure experience for all transactions.
